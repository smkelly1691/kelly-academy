<h1>The Kelly Academy</h1>
<h2>The Kelly Academy is an activity tracking application where parents of children enrolled in the school program can review 
data regarding their child's activity while at school such as specific learning activities while in class and meals served</h2>
<h2>Sometimes it can be difficult to leave your child, especially those of younger ages, for extended periods of time and being
able to access a site/app with recent data about what your child is doing can aid in relieving some of this difficulty</h2>
